        <p>In my experience with event-driven programming, I learned a range of foundational skills that extend
            beyond just programming events. One of the key areas was understanding the basics of GitHub, HTML,
            and CSS.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">GitHub Basics</h2>
        <p>GitHub plays a significant role in version control and collaboration. I learned how to
            set up repositories, manage branches, and commit changes. The most valuable aspect was understanding
            how GitHub is used to track changes in projects, collaborate with others, and manage code. The
            concept of pull requests and merging branches highlighted how teams work together to enhance code
            quality while minimizing conflicts. This was particularly useful when developing web projects.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the building blocks of any web
            page. I explored how HTML provides the structure of web pages using elements like headings,
            paragraphs, images, and links. It was fascinating to see how these elements interact to form the
            skeleton of a website.</p>

        <p>CSS, on the other hand, brings style to the structure, allowing customization of the appearance,
            layout, and design of web pages. I learned how to manipulate colors, fonts, margins, and positioning
            to create visually appealing web interfaces. Additionally, I gained experience with more advanced
            CSS concepts like flexbox and grid, which provide flexibility in layout design.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Event-Driven Integration</h2>
        <p>While learning about GitHub, HTML, and CSS, I saw how event-driven programming ties into web
            development. For instance, using JavaScript, events like button clicks or form submissions can
            trigger actions that modify HTML content or CSS styles dynamically. This made web applications
            interactive and responsive to user inputs, bridging the gap between static content and dynamic
            behavior.</p>
